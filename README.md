**ABOUT**

Fourdle is a wordle clone that operates with four letter words instead of five. Users are instructed to input a word, and for every letter in their word, they are told if it is in the correct location, or whether it is in the word at all. These clues lead the player to guessing the actual word. This word is selected from "fourdlewordslist.txt" a text file with a few words. To add words to the game, simply add them in on a new line of the text file. The game comes with an easy mode button, that provides the player with the first letter of the final word. It is a C# program built in visual studio and the GUI utilizes Windows Presentation Foundation.
